# Important

I ( Arniiiii ) don't like the code from the project.
I won't use the log library again.

Why:
 - It has 324 warnings just from tests.
 - The code uses `reinterpret_cast` like cast via C to get access to private members of some fmt classes
 - It had a memory leak which I tried to fix. Now it requires `fmtlog::poll()` every time to get it write to at an output. 
 - A test at Windows with MSVC just runs forever and I don't know why.

# What you can use instead?

On Quill's README there are some benchmark results for some log libraries you may want, so I will choose an another o    ne.

# fmtlog
fmtlog is a performant asynchronous header-only logging library using [fmt](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt) library format.

## Features
* Faster - lower runtime latency than [NanoLog](https://github.com/PlatformLab/NanoLog) and higher throughput than [spdlog](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog) (see [Performance](https://github.com/MengRao/fmtlog#Performance) below).
* Headers only
* Feature rich formatting on top of excellent fmt library.
* Asynchronous multi-threaded logging **in time order** and can also be used synchronously in single thread.
* Custom formatting
* Custom handling - user can set a callback function to handle log msgs in addition to writing into file.
* Log filtering - log levels can be modified in runtime as well as in compile time.
* Log frequency limitation - specific logs can be set a minimum logging interval.

## Platforms
* Linux (GCC 10.2,14.0 ; Clang 16.0.6 tested)
* Windows (MSVC 2019 tested)

## Install
C++17 is required, and fmtlog is dependent on [fmtlib](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt), you need to install fmtlib first if you haven't.
#### Add headers manually
Just copy `include/fmtlog/fmtlog.h` and `include/fmtlog/internal/fmtlog-inl.h` to your project and somehow link `fmtlib`.
### CMake
If you are using CMake, there's some options to add library, and some options to link fmtlib  
#### How to add library?  
##### Use add_subdirectory somehow and link fmtlib somehow 
###### CPM aka CMake's missing package manager  
Put somewhere next code (obviously after adding [CPM](https://github.com/cpm-cmake/CPM.cmake) itself ):
```
CPMAddPackage(
    NAME fmtlog 
    GIT_REPOSITORY "https://github.com/Arniiiii/fmtlog_cmake_fix.git"
    TAG master
)

target_link_libraries(<your_target_name> [PRIVATE/PUBLIC/INTERFACE] fmtlog::fmtlog)
```
###### Through a submodule
We do **not** recommend do that. Use CPM instead.  
###### Have it somewhere at your repo  
We do **not** recommend do that. Use CPM instead. 

#### How to link fmtlib?  

- Through the fmtlog library  
- Just link fmtlib with your target additionally ( do it yourself )  
##### How to link fmtlib through fmtlog library?
There's next options:  

+ if you want to use system's fmt: add `CPM_USE_LOCAL_PACKAGES ON` or add `CPM_LOCAL_PACKAGES_ONLY ON`  
+ if you want to download the fmtlib and everything that you can have from CPM  and compile all of it yourself everytime (consider installing `ccache`), add nothing or add `CPM_DOWNLOAD_ALL ON` .  

## CMake options  
Check them at `cmake/StandardSettings.cmake`  .

## Usage
```c++
#include "fmtlog/fmtlog.h"
int main() 
{
  FMTLOG(fmtlog::INF, "The answer is {}.", 42);
}
```
There're also shortcut macros `logd`, `logi`, `logw` and `loge` defined for logging `DBG`, `INF`, `WRN` and `ERR` msgs respectively:
```c++
logi("A info msg");
logd("This msg will not be logged as the default log level is INF");
fmtlog::setLogLevel(fmtlog::DBG);
logd("Now debug msg is shown");
```
Note that fmtlog is asynchronous in nature, msgs are not written into file/console immediately after the log statements: they are simply pushed into a queue. You need to call `fmtlog::poll()` to collect data from log queues, format and write it out:
```c++
fmtlog::setThreadName("aaa");
logi("Thread name is bbb in this msg");
fmtlog::setThreadName("bbb");
fmtlog::poll();
fmtlog::setThreadName("ccc");
logi("Thread name is ccc in this msg");
fmtlog::poll();
fmtlog::setThreadName("ddd");

```
fmtlog supports multi-threaded logging, but can only have one thread calling `fmtlog::poll()`. By default, fmtlog doesn't create a polling thread internally, it requires the user to poll it periodically. The idea is that this allows users to manage the threads in their own way, and have full control of polling/flushing behavior. However, you can ask  fmtlog to create a background polling thread for you by `fmtlog::startPollingThread(interval)` with a polling interval, but you can't call `fmtlog::poll()` yourself when the thread is running.

## Format
fmtlog is based on fmtlib, almost all fmtlib features are supported(except for color):
```c++
#include "fmt/ranges.h"
using namespace fmt::literals;

logi("I'd rather be {1} than {0}.", "right", "happy");
logi("Hello, {name}! The answer is {number}. Goodbye, {name}.", "name"_a = "World", "number"_a = 42);

std::vector<int> v = {1, 2, 3};
logi("ranges: {}", v);

logi("std::move can be used for objects with non-trivial destructors: {}", std::move(v));
assert(v.size() == 0);

std::tuple<int, char> t = {1, 'a'};
logi("tuples: {}", fmt::join(t, ", "));

enum class color {red, green, blue};
template <> struct fmt::formatter<color>: formatter<string_view> {
  // parse is inherited from formatter<string_view>.
  template <typename FormatContext>
  auto format(color c, FormatContext& ctx) {
    string_view name = "unknown";
    switch (c) {
    case color::red:   name = "red"; break;
    case color::green: name = "green"; break;
    case color::blue:  name = "blue"; break;
    }
    return formatter<string_view>::format(name, ctx);
  }
};
logi("user defined type: {:>10}", color::blue);
logi("{:*^30}", "centered");
logi("int: {0:d};  hex: {0:#x};  oct: {0:#o};  bin: {0:#b}", 42);
logi("dynamic precision: {:.{}f}", 3.14, 1);

// This gives a compile-time error because d is an invalid format specifier for a string.
// FMT_STRING() is not needed from C++20 onward
logi(FMT_STRING("{:d}"), "I am not a number");
```
As an asynchronous logging library, fmtlog provides additional support for passing arguments by pointers(which is seldom needed for fmtlib and it only supports void and char pointers). User can pass a pointer of any type as argument to avoid copy overhead if the lifetime of referred object is assured(otherwise the polling thread will refer to a dangling pointer!). For string arg as an example, fmtlog copies string content for type `std::string` by default, but only a pointer for type `std::string*`:
```c++
  std::string str = "aaa";
  logi("str: {}, pstr: {}", str, &str);
  str = "bbb";
  fmtlog::poll();
  // output: str: aaa, pstr: bbb
```
In addition to raw pointers, fmtlog supports `std::shared_ptr` and `std::unique_ptr` as well, which makes object lifetime management much easier:
```c++
  int a = 4;
  auto sptr = std::make_shared<int>(5);
  auto uptr = std::make_unique<int>(6);
  logi("void ptr: {}, ptr: {}, sptr: {}, uptr: {}", (void*)&a, &a, sptr, std::move(uptr));
  a = 7;
  *sptr = 8;
  fmtlog::poll();
  // output: void ptr: 0x7ffd08ac53ac, ptr: 7, sptr: 8, uptr: 6
```

Log header pattern can also be customized with `fmtlog::setHeaderPattern()` and the argument is a fmtlib format string with named arguments. The default header pattern is "{HMSf} {s:<16} {l}[{t:<6}] " (example: "15:46:19.149844 log_test.cc:43   INF[448050] "). All supported named arguments in header are as below:
| Name | Meaning| Example |
| :------ | :-------: | :-----: |
|`l`|Log level|INF|
|`s`|File base name and line num|log_test.cc:48|
|`g`|File path and line num|/home/raomeng/fmtlog/log_test.cc:48|
|`t`|Thread id by default, can be reset by `fmt::setThreadName()`|main|
|`a`|Weekday|Mon|
|`b`|Month name|May|
|`Y`|Year|2021|
|`C`|Short year|21|
|`m`|Month|05|
|`d`|Day|03|
|`H`|Hour|16|
|`M`|Minute|08|
|`S`|Second|09|
|`e`|Millisecond|796|
|`f`|Microsecond|796341|
|`F`|Nanosecond|796341126|
|`Ymd`|Year-Month-Day|2021-05-03|
|`HMS`|Hour:Minute:Second|16:08:09|
|`HMSe`|Hour:Minute:Second.Millisecond|16:08:09.796|
|`HMSf`|Hour:Minute:Second.Microsecond|16:08:09.796341|
|`HMSF`|Hour:Minute:Second.Nanosecond|16:08:09.796341126|
|`YmdHMS`|Year-Month-Day Hour:Minute:Second|2021-05-03 16:08:09|
|`YmdHMSe`|Year-Month-Day Hour:Minute:Second.Millisecond|2021-05-03 16:08:09.796|
|`YmdHMSf`|Year-Month-Day Hour:Minute:Second.Microsecond|2021-05-03 16:08:09.796341|
|`YmdHMSF`|Year-Month-Day Hour:Minute:Second.Nanosecond|2021-05-03 16:08:09.796341126|

Note that using concatenated named args is more efficient than seperated ones, e.g. `{YmdHMS}` is faster than `{Y}-{m}-{d} {H}:{M}:{S}`.

## Output
By default, fmtlog output to stdout. Normally users want to write to a log file instead, this is accomplished by `fmtlog::setLogFile(filename,truncate)`. For performance, fmtlog internally buffer data, and under certain conditions will the buffer be flushed into the underlying file. The flushing conditions are:
* The underlying FILE* is not managed by fmtlog, then fmtlog will not buffer at all. For example, the default stdout FILE* will not be buffered. User can also pass an existing FILE* and indicate whether fmtlog should manage it by `fmtlog::setLogFile(fp, manageFp)`, e.g. `fmtlog::setLogFile(stderr, false)`, then fmtlog will log into stderr without buffering.
* The buffer size is larger than 8 KB, this number can be reset by `fmtlog::setFlushBufSize(bytes)`.
* The oldest data in the buffer has passed a specified duration. The duration is by default 3 seconds, and can be set by `fmtlog::setFlushDelay(ns)`.
* The new log has at least a specified flush log level. The default flush log level can't be reached by any log, but it can be set by `fmtlog::flushOn(logLevel)`.
* User can actively ask fmtlog to flush by `fmtlog::poll(true)`.

Optionally, user can ask fmtlog to close the log file by `fmtlog::closeLogFile()`, and subsequent log msgs will not be output.

In addition to writing to a FILE*, user can register a callback function to handle log msgs by `fmtlog::setLogCB(cb, minCBLogLevel)`. This can be useful in circumstances where warning/error msgs need to be published out in real time for alerting purposes. Log callback will not be buffered as log file, and can be triggered even when the file is closed.
The signature of callback function is:
```c++
  // callback signature user can register
  // ns: nanosecond timestamp
  // level: logLevel
  // location: full file path with line num, e.g: /home/raomeng/fmtlog/fmtlog.h:45
  // basePos: file base index in the location
  // threadName: thread id or the name user set with setThreadName
  // msg: full log msg with header
  // bodyPos: log body index in the msg
  // logFilePos: log file position of this msg
  typedef void (*LogCBFn)(int64_t ns, LogLevel level, fmt::string_view location, size_t basePos,
                          fmt::string_view threadName, fmt::string_view msg, size_t bodyPos, size_t logFilePos);
```

## Performance
Benchmark is done in terms of both front-end latency and throughput, with comparisons to Nanolog and spdlog basic_logger_st. Test log messages use  [NanoLog benchmark Log-Messages-Map](https://github.com/PlatformLab/NanoLog#Log-Messages-Map), and header pattern uses spdlog default pattern(e.g. "[2021-05-04 10:36:38.098] [spdlog] [info] [bench.cc:111] "), check [bench.cc](https://github.com/MengRao/fmtlog/blob/main/bench/bench.cc) for details. 

The results on a linux server with "Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6144 CPU @ 3.50GHz" is:
| Message | fmtlog | Nanolog | spdlog |
|---------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|
|staticString |6.4 ns, 7.08 M/s|6.5 ns, 33.10 M/s|156.4 ns, 6.37 M/s|
|stringConcat |6.4 ns, 6.05 M/s|7.5 ns, 14.20 M/s|209.4 ns, 4.77 M/s|
|singleInteger |6.3 ns, 6.22 M/s|6.5 ns, 50.29 M/s|202.3 ns, 4.94 M/s|
|twoIntegers |6.4 ns, 4.87 M/s|6.6 ns, 39.25 M/s|257.2 ns, 3.89 M/s|
|singleDouble |6.2 ns, 5.37 M/s|6.5 ns, 39.62 M/s|225.0 ns, 4.44 M/s|
|complexFormat |6.4 ns, 2.95 M/s|6.7 ns, 24.30 M/s|390.9 ns, 2.56 M/s|

Note that the throughput of Nanolog is not comparable here because it outputs to binary log file instead of human-readable text format, e.g. it saves an int64 timestamp instead of a long formatted date time string.

How can fmtlog achieve such low and stable latency? Two key optimization techniques are employed inspired by Nanolog:

One is allocating a single producer single consumer queue for each logging thread, and have the background thread polling for all these queues. This avoids threads contention and performance will not deteriorate when thread number increases. The queue is automatically created on the first log msg of a thread, so queue is not created for threads that don't use fmtlog. The thread queue has a default size of 1 MB(can be changed by macro `FMTLOG_QUEUE_SIZE`), and it takes a little time to allocate the queue. It's recommended that user actively calls `fmt::preallocate()` once the thread is created, so even the first log can have low latency. 

What happens when the queue is full? By default, fmtlog simply dump addtional log msgs and return. Alternatively, front-end logging can be blocked while the queue is full by defining macro `FMTLOG_BLOCK=1`, then no log will be missing. User can register a callback function when log queue is full by `fmtlog::setLogQFullCB(cb, userData)`, by which user can be aware that the consumer(polling thread) is not keeping up. Normally, the queue being full is seldom a problem, but incautious user could leave log statements that are invoked in an unexpected high frequency, e.g. a tcp client spamming with "Connection refused" errors without a connection retry delay. To handle this problem in an elegant way, fmtlog provides a log macro which limits frequency of this log: `FMTLOG_LIMIT` and 4 shortcuts `logdl`, `logil`, `logwl` and `logel` respectively, user needs to pass the mininum interval in nanosecond as the first argument, e.g. 
```c++
logil(1e9, "this log will be displayed at most once per second").
```

The other optimization is that static information of a log(such as format string, log level and location) is saved in a table at its first call, and fmtlog simply pushes the index of the static info table entry with dynamic arguments to the queue, minimizing the msg size. In addition, fmtlog defines a decoding function for each log statment, which is invoked in `fmtlog::poll()` when the log msg is popped from the queue. 

However, these decoding functions bloat program size with each function consuming around 50 bytes. In addition, the static infomation entry also consumes 50-ish bytes runtime memory for each log statement. Such memory overhead may not be worthwhile for those infrequent and latency insensitive logs(e.g. program initialization info), thus fmtlog provides user with another log macro which disables this optimization: `FMTLOG_ONCE` and of couse shortcuts: `logdo`, `logio`, `logwo`and `logeo`. `FMTLOG_ONCE` will not create a static info table entry, nor add a decoding function: it pushes static info along with formatted msg body onto the queue. Note that passing argument by pointer is not supported by `FMTLOG_ONCE`.

For those who prefer to further optimize memory usage by filtering log at compile time, macro `FMTLOG_ACTIVE_LEVEL` is applied with a default value `FMTLOG_LEVEL_INF`, meaning debug logs will simply be discarded at compile time. Note that `FMTLOG_ACTIVE_LEVEL` only applies to log shortcut macros, e.g. `logi`, but not `FMTLOG`. Similarly, runtime log level filtering can be disabled by defining macro `FMTLOG_NO_CHECK_LEVEL`, which will increase performance and reduce generated code size a bit.
